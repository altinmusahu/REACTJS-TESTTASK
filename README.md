# REACTJS-TESTTASK

Single page application with CRUD operations, registering contact in phone book where I was implementing with localstorage in browser of application, but I changed and worked in noSQL mongoDB where i stored contacts data, fetched them and manipulating with them.

in "vite-project" directory you should write npm install also in "server" directory you should write npm install
